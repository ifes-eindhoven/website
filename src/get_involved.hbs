    <h2 id="events">HOST Meetings</h2>
    <hr class="ruler">
    <p>
      Every two weeks, we meet with each other on Friday from 18:00, to share a meal and participate in an
      activity afterwards. The activity can be something like a Bible study, or a cultural/social activity. During
      these meetings, you get to know some Dutch, but mainly international students who are also living in
      Eindhoven. Check our Facebook page for details on the next meeting!
    </p>

    <h2 class="mt-5">Small Groups</h2>
    <hr class="ruler">
    <p>
      In the weeks that we donâ€™t share a meal with all of HOST, we organize small group meetings. For these, we
      meet as a small group of people, have dinner together, and engage in a more personal Bible study and
      fellowship afterwards. During these studies, we want to learn more about what it means to be a Christian in
      our daily lives and continue to grow further. If you are interested in participating, please contact us for
      more information.
    </p>

    <h2 class="mt-5">Other Events</h2>

      from random dinners and BBQs, to celebrations of Kings Day, Sinterklaas, Chinese New Year, Christmas, and
      Easter.

    <h2 class="mt-5">Family Project</h2>
    <hr class="ruler">
    <p>
      Would you like to learn more about Dutch culture and experience Dutch hospitality firsthand? The <span>HOST
        family project</span> wants to help you feel at home and make the most of your
      experience as an international student in the Netherlands. We do this by pairing you with a Dutch family
      form a local church, which gives you the opportunity to build meaningful relationships over a tasty meal in
      a family setting. </p> <br />

    <p>
      If you are interested in participating in the family project please contact us and we will pair you with a
      Dutch family from one of the various participating local churches. You can specify whether you would like to
      visit by yourself, be paired up with another student, or if you would prefer to bring a friend along. After
      you have met your HOST family for the first time, you can decide together with them if and when you would
      like to have your next meeting. We, and the Dutch, are keen to meet you!

          <p>HOST is a community for international students that
            aims to help international students to feel at home in Eindhoven. At HOST you can expect hospitality, to
            build friendships, and to be encouraged to meet God. We organize various formal and informal events,
            focussed on helping Christian international students grow in their faith and share experiences. These
            events also include activities that are a lot of fun, and involve cultural exchange. However, you donâ€™t
            have to be a Christian to come along; we welcome all students regardless of their cultural background or
            religion!</p><br />

          <p>HOST Eindhoven is part of IFES (International
            Fellowship of Evangelical Students), an organization supporting ministries to international students in
            cities all over the globe, among which 20 cities in the Netherlands. Furthermore, IFES Netherlands
            organizes a number of activities where you can meet many international students studying in different
            cities in the Netherlands.</p>
